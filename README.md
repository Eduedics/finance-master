# Finance Master

Being 25 has taught me the importance of financial management. In the past, I didn’t clearly track where my money went. But as time passes, things are starting to make sense.

Watching our parents grow older and still struggle to make ends meet — mostly due to limited budgeting knowledge and fund mismanagement — has been a big wake-up call. This inspired me to build Finance Master, a simple but powerful financial management web app.
Purpose

The app is designed to help with:

    Tracking cash inflow and outflow

    Automatically applying the 30:30:15:15 rule on any income:

        30% → Savings

        30% → Bills

        15% → Food

        15% → Miscellaneous / Coverage

    Creating financial discipline through visibility and smart alerts

Key Features

    Real-time notifications of current balance and category breakdown

    Alerts for every transaction made

    Warning when balance falls below a set threshold

    Freeze warning (no further transactions allowed) if account gets too low

Tech Stack

    Frontend: (your stack here, e.g., React, Vue, HTML/CSS/JS)

    Backend: (if applicable, e.g., Node.js, Django, Laravel)

    Database: (e.g., MySQL, MongoDB, Firebase)

Future Plans

    Add user authentication (sign up / login)

    Monthly and yearly financial reports

    Goal setting and savings tracker

    Support for multiple accounts (e.g., bank, mobile money)

How to Use

    Login or create an account

    Add income (salary, side hustle, etc.)

    App auto-allocates funds using 30:30:15:15 rule

    Track all transactions and get alerts

    Monitor your balance and freeze spending when needed

If you want, I can help write the Installation section too, depending on the stack you're using. Want to add that next?

may be react (frontend and django backend)

Great combo — React + Django is solid. Here's the updated README.md with an Installation section tailored to that stack:
