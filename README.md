# Finance Master

Being 25 has taught me the importance of financial management. In the past, I didn’t clearly track where my money went. But as time passes, things are starting to make sense.

Watching our parents grow older and still struggle to make ends meet — mostly due to limited budgeting knowledge and fund mismanagement — has been a big wake-up call. This inspired me to build Finance Master, a simple but powerful financial management web app.
